ISO 27001 is an international standard that provides a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). The purpose of the standard is to help organizations protect their confidential, sensitive, and critical data from various threats such as unauthorized access, theft, modification, or deletion. An ISMS based on ISO 27001 can help organizations comply with various legal, contractual, and regulatory requirements related to information security. It focuses on a risk-based approach for selecting, implementing, and monitoring security controls to mitigate potential risks.
